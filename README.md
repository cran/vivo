## Overview

The `vivo` package helps to calculate 

**- instance level variable importance (local sensitivity).**

The measure is based on Ceteris Paribus profiles and can be calculated in eight variants. Select the variant
that suits your needs by setting parameters: `absolute_deviation`,
`point` and `density`.

**- model level variable importance (global sensitivity).**

The measure is based on Partial Dependence Profiles. 

## vivo package

The main functions are `global_variable_importance()` and `local_variable_importance()`.

`vivo` is a part of [DrWhy](https://github.com/ModelOriented/DrWhy)
collection of tools for Visual Exploration, Explanation and Debugging of
Predictive Models.

## Installation

From CRAN

``` r
install.packages("vivo")
```

From GitHub

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ModelOriented/vivo")
```

## Intuition

#### Local variable importance 

Ceteris Paribus is a latin phrase meaning „other things held constant”
or „all else unchanged”. Ceteris Paribus Plots show how the model
response depends on changes in a single input variable, keeping all
other variables unchanged. They work for any Machine Learning model and
allow for model comparisons to better understand how a black model
works.

The measure is based on Ceteris Paribus profiles oscillations. In
particular, the larger influence of an explanatory variable on
prediction at a particular instance, the larger the deviation along the
corresponding Ceteris Paribus profile. For a variable that exercises
little or no influence on model prediction, the profile will be flat or
will barely change.

#### Global variable importance

Here we have a similar intuition as above, but we are looking at Partial Dependence Profiles, because they show how the prediction changes for the model, not only for observation.
