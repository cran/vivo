\title{Local Variable Importance measure based on Ceteris Paribus profiles.}
\usage{
local_variable_importance(profiles, data, absolute_deviation = TRUE,
  point = TRUE, density = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{profiles}{data.frame generated by ingredients::ceteris_paribus()}

\item{data}{data.frame with raw data to model}

\item{absolute_deviation}{logical parameter, if `absolute_deviation = TRUE` then measure is calculated as absolute deviation, else is calculated as a root from average squares}

\item{point}{logical parameter, if `point = TRUE` then measure is calculated as a distance from f(x), else measure is calculated as a distance from average profiles}

\item{density}{logical parameter, if `density = TRUE` then measure is weighted based on the density of variable, else is not weighted}
}
\value{
A data.frame of the class 'local_variable_importance'.
It's a data.frame with calculated local variable importance measure.
}
\description{
This function calculate local importance measure in eight variants. We obtain eight variants measure through the possible options of three parameters such as `absolute_deviation`, `point` and `density`.
